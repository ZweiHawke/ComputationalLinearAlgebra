Hi there! This is Rigby Bradshaw

Programming for python was done in Repl.it with the most recent version of python.

Game Maker Studio was used for visual elements.

Matricies in text files are sperated by spaces and newlines.

A matrix of 3x4 looks like:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

Screenshots are included but so are executables.
